My Programming Journey
Hello! This page is all about my adventure into the world of programming. I'm diving into various tech areas, like JavaScript, MySQL, and Jekyll. I'll be sharing my progress, experiences, and the cool projects I'm working on to level up my skills.

About Me
I'm a newbie in the programming world, and I'm super excited to explore web development. Here's what I'm focusing on:

JavaScript (JS): I'm playing around with JavaScript to create interactive web apps and make user experiences better.
MySQL: I'm getting to know databases and how they store and retrieve data using MySQL.
Jekyll: I'm using Jekyll to build static websites and blogs, and I'm learning the ropes.
Projects

In my learning journey, I'm tackling different projects, such as:

My personal website, made with Jekyll, to show off my skills and achievements.
A web app using JavaScript for a specific task.
A project that uses MySQL to handle data.
