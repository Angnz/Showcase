# Why Opt for "Data Science"?
"Data Science" stands as an interdisciplinary realm that embraces the utilization of data to derive meaningful knowledge. It encompasses the entire process of refining raw data into practical insights, adaptable to a wide spectrum of fields and applications. Numerous scientific disciplines, such as the social sciences, economics, law, and business administration, are witnessing substantial shifts, with data science emerging as an indispensable and progressively pivotal element within each of these domains."

# The challenge of the “big data” revolution

Volume: Big data is characterized by the enormous quantity of data generated and collected. The sheer size of this data can determine its value and potential for discovering valuable insights. This aspect is often represented in terms of terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes of information.

Variety: Another crucial facet of big data is its variety. It encompasses various types of data, including structured and unstructured data. This includes text, images, audio, video, and more. The ability to handle and make sense of these diverse data types is a significant challenge.

Velocity: Velocity refers to the speed at which new data is generated and the pace at which data moves through systems. In the digital age, data is produced rapidly, often in real-time. This rapid flow of information presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations.

Veracity: Veracity relates to the quality of the data. Big data sources can vary greatly in terms of accuracy and reliability. Managing and ensuring data quality is a persistent challenge, as incorrect or untrustworthy data can lead to incorrect conclusions.

The primary challenge of the "big data" revolution lies in effectively collecting, storing, analyzing, and deriving value from these massive, diverse, and fast-moving data volumes. Companies like IBM have dedicated efforts to provide solutions that harness big data through technologies like Hadoop, advanced analytics tools, cloud computing, and more. However, the successful utilization of big data goes beyond technology alone.

Organizations need the right skills, infrastructure, and frameworks to leverage big data effectively. Issues surrounding privacy, security, and data governance also come to the forefront. In summary, big data presents immense opportunities for gaining insights and making informed decisions, but it also poses multiple technological and organizational challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.

## Moore’s Law has held true for more than half a century
In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that this growth would continue for another 10 years, at least. Was he right In the chart, we’ve visualized the growth in transistor density – the number of transistors on integrated circuits – from 1970 onwards. It looks strikingly similar to Moore’s simple plot from 1965. Note again that the transistor count is on a logarithmic axis, so the linear relationship over time means that the growth rate has been constant. This means that the growth of the transistor count has, in fact, been exponential. You can also see this on our interactive chart, which shows the average transistor count over time and where you can switch between a linear and a log axis. Transistor counts have doubled approximately every two years, just as Moore predicted. This has held true for more than 50 years now.(ourworldindata.org)
